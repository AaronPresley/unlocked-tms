# Unlocked TMS

**Warning: This is a pet project that will likely never be completed.**

## The Problem

Translation Management Systems have a lot of great features: Figma plugins, SDK's, etc. However these features often deepend your dependence on the vendor, without the ability to easy move elsewhere.

## My Proposed Solution

I can't claim to know what the hell I'm doing, but in my experience I think a great TMS would:

- Allow me to have unlimited projects and unlimited users without additional cost
- Support Pseudo Translation out of the box
- Have the fancy design plugins and SDK's without the vendor lock-in
- Allow anyone to host the TMS in whatever way they prefer

Maybe this project will turn into that. For now, it's a project I poke with a stick when I have the time.
